# Project work 2

Week 10 is the third and last week in a series in which the goal is to improve your 
personal software engineering practice. Your portfolio entry has the same general content
as last week's, including:

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

In the reflective sections this week, you should highlight ways that you persona practice
has improved as before. It would also be good to reflect on any improvements that have
been made to the agreed team workflow and related procedures. Are things working
better than they were? What further improvements could be made in the future?

## Summary of Issue 

The main point of this issue is to efficiently find and invite the right partner agencies to join their team, while the business aims to give their teams access to external resources . To achieve this, the system needs to meet a set of criteria, like showing partner agencies with their current association status (requested, denied, confirmed, pending, N/A, etc), providing easy access to specfic agency details, allowing for a text search to filter the agency list and allowing that text search to be cleared. In essence, the system should make it easier to identify, engage, and view partner agencies.This allows for improved efficiency and access to external resources and support for the UN.
