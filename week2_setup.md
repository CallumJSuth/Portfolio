# Description of Task 

For this week we were tasked with setting up the basic stucture and resources we would use throughout the year and any further projects. 

Individually, we were also tasked with setting up Visual Studio to a set of specifications and setting up a portfolio (The one you are on now!) for displaying future  work. 

# Evidence of Work 

## Group Git Repository 

Our group (Purple) set up a group Github Repository as seen in screenshot (). This will be very useful as a hub for all of a work and also allows us to work on projects in tandem with each other and offer changes and optimizations to code. Although basic at this stage, this will go on to become very devloped as the course progresses. 

Setting up a project in this repository was also a required part of this task, ensuring it had an intergated task board which helps with keeping are group work organised and up to date. This can be seen in screenshot () and (). 

## Personal Tasks 

I was required to set up Visual Studio from scratch as I had never worked with it before. This entailed going through this instalation process as well as customising it based on specifcations given to us. This allows us to use it to work on future tasks using VS. I also tailored VS to my personal prefrences (However not a lot was changes). This is shown in screeshots () and ().

Furthermore, creating a portfolio on Github for posting my work was required. This is shown in screenshot () or just by going to the main page of this repository
