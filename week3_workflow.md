# Week 3 - Workflow 

This week, our group was tasked with choosing an appropriate work flow, implementing it and further devloping it by adding tasks that will be indiviudally completed by each member.

We were also tasked with individually getting more familar with Github's workflow tools, allowing us to more easily utilise the resourses Github offers. This consisted of showing that we were able to use the following processes :

Firstly, I created a branch in order to deviate my changes from the main code and then later push these changes to the main repository. :
