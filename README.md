# SET09102 portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, showcasing the projects and work I've completed during my time at Napier University.

At Napier University, I have been given the opportunity to immerse myself in a world of coding and teamwork with fellow students. This portfolio is a curated collection of projects that represent the skills and experiences I've gained as a developer.

As my education carrer progresses you'll find a range of projects, each showcasing a different aspect of my development as a software engineer. From coding assignments to collaborative group efforts, this repository demonstrate my commitment to creating functional and efficient solutions.

Let's get started, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
